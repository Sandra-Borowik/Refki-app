## An app that I made for my own use, when i was a graphic designer.

The inspiration was the PureRef App (https://www.pureref.com/).

At the time I was making this app, PureRef didn't have the option of tracing photos, so I made my own version with filters.

### About the Refki Application
The app has a gallery in which I put my own references to folders, so I can access them easily (the uploaded version includes AI-generated images).

After selecting images that you would like to use as references by double-clicking on them, \
a reference window appears, which contains the selected image from the gallery.

From this window You can:
- rotate the picture
- flip horizontally and vertically
- use magnifier to see datails
- switch to grayscale
- use edge detection (white on black and black on white mode)
- use the blur and sharpen mode

The most important feature is that you can choose whether the photo is displayed above other apps or not. \
You can also use the tracing tool, which makes the window invisible to the mouse and changes the opacity of the picture, allowing you to see behind it.
